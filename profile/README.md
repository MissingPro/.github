Alright so since GitHub is recommending me to put a list of stuff inside here, I might as well follow along.  
## I'm currently working on...  
[X](https://github.com/9Studio-LLC/XTools), [Eraser Soccer](https://missingpro.itch.io/eraser-soccer), [Hexagons are the Worstagons: GDevelop Edition](https://missingpro.itch.io/hex-are-the-wor-gdevelop) and a secret game about beans... :)
## I'm currently learning...
JavaScript.
## I'm looking to collaborate on...
X, I guess?
## Ask me about...
I don't know, whatever you wanna ask me about XD
### How to reach me
Probably to your left (or if you're somehow reading the .github repo from my profile, it's... well... on my profile.).
## Pronouns
I'm a boy, call me he.
## Fun fact
The longest word I know is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.
